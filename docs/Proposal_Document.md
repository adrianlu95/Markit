#3.0

##3.1 Verbal Description

Working with awful database systems is miserable for any developer. Using the wrong database model for the given application adds unnecessary complications and can feel a lot like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Sure, with enough pain and force you can make it work eventually, but why go through the hassle? In this vein of thought, my plan for this semester is to shift MarkIt away from using Firebase, and start from the ground up with a brand new relational database written in either MySQL or SQLite. In addition, I plan to host the application using Heroku, so that should there be continued development on other platforms, there is just a single backend for them to communicate with. Beyond these goals, I also plan to continue standard development of MarkIt, and implement the features that we were unable to achieve last semester.

##3.2 Justification

My plan to work towards these goals began last semester while working on the app, as many of the people, myself included, who were in the group did not like working with Firebase at all. The issue that became immediately obvious to me last semester was that MarkIt essentially needs a relational database. This is because we have many different data points (Users, Items for sale, Hubs) that are all deeply interconnected. What we had to do for this in Firebase was store all of our data 3 times, sorted differently for access by different means. However if this was to be redone using something like MySQL or SQLite, I could make use of the advantages of relational databases, which would be a far more elegant and efficient solution. This will take full advantage of my concurrent class CMSI 486, Databases, and beyond this, will let me apply the knowledge to a real world situation. I believe that this goal is achievable because I have some prior knowledge of database manipulation and implementation, however making such a radical change to a preexisting piece of software will be a new challenge. My previous work with databases left me looking forward to future chances to continue the experience and this project gives me the perfect opportunity to do so.

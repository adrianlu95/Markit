## 5.1 Introduction
This requirements specification is for Markit, a selling and trading application for Web, iOS, and Android. Users will be able to sell used items to specific college communities as well as purchase these items from sellers in the application. Each user will have a profile containing basic personal information, payment preferences, a list of items the user is selling, a list of items the user has shown interest in purchasing, and a list of tags the user is interested in purchasing. Users will search for purchasable items by location, with the option of filtering by tags. A list of these items will be shown to the user. When a user finds an item they would like to purchase, they will communicate with the seller in the application using a chat system.  The remainder of this document is structured as follows: section 5.3 contains the functional requirements, section 5.4 contains the performance requirements, and section 5.5 contains the environment requirements.<br />
